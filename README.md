## Atsava - Open Source Enterprise Portal Framework

Atsava is built on open standards-based technologies such as PHP and Javascript, and enables easy, standards-based integration with authentication and campus applications, web-based content, and end user customization.

It is built on [Laravel 7.2](http://laravel.com).

Atsava can easily integrate with other enterprise systems and can be customized for specific local needs. The user experience is further enhanced and made accessible through use of the Fluid skinning system. The powerful layout management system enables a dynamic, personal view for users with multiple roles.
